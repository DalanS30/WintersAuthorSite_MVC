    <snippet>Kick out the jams, horror lover! It's time to hit the pit and have your spines tingled, because this collection of stories was born to be wild! Each of these nine tales was inspired by a tasty lick of the hard rock or heavy metal variety, so get ready to thrash and crash to the brutal beats inside! These stories will take you to the big-haired 80s, post-apocalyptic nightmares, and beyond. Flee through the misty forests of Japan; have a slice of pizza that's truly out of this world; suffer a workday from Hell; fight for love and life in the ruins of Las Vegas -- and of course, keep on rockin' through it all! Now throw those horns up, bang your head, and enjoy the musical madness!!!</snippet>
